# Course description
The goal of the course is to enable students to master the engineering methods and processes that are necessary to produce complex software with industrial strength quality. The course covers the software process and its organization, requirements, design methods and tools, specification, verification and validation. Each topic is treated both theoretically and practically through a project work.
